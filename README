Run the application as follows from command line
./gradlew MixTapes -Pargs="c:\\mixtapes\\mixtape-data.json c:\\mixtapes\\changes.json"

This program using fasterxml ObjectMapper to convert the json file to object.
The ObjectMapper has to construct the entire object tree before returning it.
It will need whatever amount of memory is required to build the objects in that tree.

For huge files, it would be better to read the file and load into a no sql database like MongoDB or MySQL.
Or read each object and cache it, so it is readily available for updates.

The changes do not need much change as I am using HashMap, where updates and deletes will take O(1) to retrieve the playlist and modify.
Initialy it will take O(n) to load the playlist into the HashMap.

Later just replaces the new playlist with the old playlist and writes to a separate file.
